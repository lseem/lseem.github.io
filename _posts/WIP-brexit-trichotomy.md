# The Trichotomy

Let's assume that a true brexit is only one in which the UK leaves the Single
Market and Customs Union. Then the following three things are all together not
possible:
* brexit,
* respecting the Good Friday Agreement,
* keeping the Union intact.

The Good Friday Agreement is based on free movement between Northern Ireland
and the Republic of Ireland [source], and this free movement requires that
NI and the ROI be part of the same customs union; the ROI happens to be part of
the EU Customs Union which also requires the Single Market [check all this,
citaton]. Thus respecting the GFA requires free movement which requries that NI
be part of the SM and CU.
