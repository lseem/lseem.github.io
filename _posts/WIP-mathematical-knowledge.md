Most readers might accept that knowledge of the external world is impossible
due to the Argument from the Sceptical Hypotheses, yet many might still believe
that mathematical knowledge - that is, knowledge relating to propositions of a
mathematical nature - is possible. In this post, we outline an argument as to
why this might not be the case.

The main claim to the truth of mathematical knowledge is that each theorem can
be proved, with a _proof_, which is a valid argument based on some axioms. The
theorem is true, because it is (or can easily be reduced to) a statement of the
form $P\arrow Q$ (where $P$ and $Q$ are proposition and $P$ is the hypothesis
and $Q$ is the conclusion) and the argument with assumption $P$ and conclusion
$Q$ is valid.

Yet what checks the validity of the argument? A human? Humans make mistakes in
their calculations. A computer? A sceptical hypothesis will do away with that.
