      <description>Introduction The motivation for the concept of a chain homotopy is to abstract the prism operator to a more algebraic setting.
Note that this diagram is not a &amp;ldquo;commutative diagram&amp;rdquo;, but since \(f\) and \(g\) are chain maps, there are two commutative &amp;ldquo;sub&amp;rdquo;-diagrams.
Definition If \(C_\bullet\) and \(D_\bullet\) are chain complexes, and \(f,g:C_\bullet\to D_\bullet\) are chain maps, then a *chain homotopy* from \(f\) to \(g\) is a colleciton of homomorphisms \(P:C_n\to D_{n+1}\) such that for all \(n\),</description>

      <description>Introduction Homotopy invariance is a key theorem from algebraic topology. It says that if two maps are homotopic then they induce the same singular homology homomorphism. The prerequisite notions for this theorem are singular homology and the prism operator.
Statement and Proof Theorem: Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. If \(f,g:X\to Y\) are homotopic, then their induced singular homology homomorphisms are equal:
\[ f_* = g_* : H_n(X) \to H_n(Y).</description>

      <description>Introduction The motivation for studying the prism operator comes from proving homotopy invariance. The prism operator takes a singular n-chain and forms a singular (n+1)-chain from it by passing the n-chain through a homotopy, creating &amp;ldquo;prisms&amp;rdquo; in the process.
As an introduction, we first study the 2-dimensional case. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces, \(H:X\times I\to Y\) be a homotopy, and \(\sigma:\Delta^2\to X\) be a singular 2-simplex in \(X\). We can then form a prism by passing \(\sigma\) through the homotopy:</description>
