      <description>I have uploaded two new videos for the Multivarible Calculus revision series about submanifolds (which you can find under Resources:
 Part 2 - Tangent Spaces Part 3 - Level Sets as Submanifolds  While the video on tangent spaces was relatively easy, the other video about level sets was much harder. It is a more difficult topic to explain, and it took me a while to find the right picture which will give everything in detail.</description>

      <title>Revision Videos for Multivariable Calculus at Warwick</title>
      <link>http://lseem.xyz/posts/revision-videos-for-multivariable-calculus-at-warwick/</link>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/posts/revision-videos-for-multivariable-calculus-at-warwick/</guid>
      <description>I have in the past few days uploaded some revision videos for the Multivariable Calculus course at Warwick (2020 &amp;ndash; 2021) taught by Mario Micallef. You can find them under Resources. Currently, they contain references to &amp;ldquo;the notes&amp;rdquo;. I may update them at some later point, removing all such references.
The point of the videos is not to go over the rigour and the proofs, but to give a higher level and intuitive view of the course.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is an overview article for algebraic topology.
Typical Undergraduate Course A typical undergraduate course in algebraic topology will consist of the following topics:
 simplicial homology (broken link) singular homology (broken link)  homotopy invariance mayer vietoris (broken link) relative homology reduced homology (broken link)    References and Notes  This article is based on a lecture course on algebraic topology given at Warwick by Chris Lazda.</description>

      <description>Introduction Let \(X\) be a topological space and let \(A\subset X\). Intuitively, the relative homology of \(A\) in \(X\) is the &amp;ldquo;homology where we don&amp;rsquo;t care about what happens in A&amp;rdquo;.
Definitions Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(A\subset X\). Then the group of \(n\)-cycles in \(A\) is a subgroup of the group of \(n\)-cycles in \(X\). Therefore the boundary map \(\partial:C_n(X)\to C_{n-1}(X)\) descends to a map on the quotients</description>

      <title>Important Theoremata of Undergraduate Mathematics</title>
      <link>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/important-theoremata-undergraduate-mathematics/</link>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/important-theoremata-undergraduate-mathematics/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this overview article, I list some theoremata that I think should summarise an undergraduate mathematics degree.
Often, I can get overwhelmed by the details of a course, and so I find it useful to just sit down and list the main results. Usually, they only take up half a page. Then, I focus on figuring out the proofs of these main results, and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all I need to know for the course: there&amp;rsquo;s no need to actively try to remember the definition of some obscure object, because chances are it&amp;rsquo;s been defined just to be able to prove a theorem (there are some important definitions, but I&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up remembering them just by the sheer number of times I use them while learning the subject).</description>

      <title>Exact Sequence</title>
      <link>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/exact-sequence/</link>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/exact-sequence/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The motivation for this algebraic structure comes from abstracting out important features of the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence.
Definitions A sequence of abelian groups and homomorphisms
\[ A_n \overset{d_n}{\longrightarrow} \cdots \longrightarrow A_{i+1} \overset{d_{i+1}}{\longrightarrow} A_i \overset{d_i}{\longrightarrow} A_{i-1} \longrightarrow \cdots \overset{d_1}{\longrightarrow} A_0 \]
is exact at \(A_i\) if \(\ker d_i = {\rm im}d_{i+1}\). This only makes sense for \(0&amp;lt;i&amp;lt;n\).
We say that the above sequence is exact if it is exact at \(A_i\) for all \(0&amp;lt;i&amp;lt;n\).</description>

      <title>Chain Complex</title>

      <description>Introduction Definitions A chain complex is a sequence of abelian groups \( C_n \) (one for each \( n\in\mathbb{Z} \)) together with maps \( d_n:C_n\to C_{n-1} \) called *differentials* such that \( d_nd_{n+1}=0 \) for every \( n\in\mathbb{Z} \).
We define the group of n-cycles \(Z_n(C_\bullet) := \ker(d_n:C_n\to C_{n-1})\), and we define the *group of n-boundaries* \(B_n(C_\bullet) := {\rm im}(d_{n+1}:C_{n+1}\to C_n)\).
Since \(d^2=0\), \(B_n\subset Z_n\). This permits us to define the n-homology group to be the quotient</description>

      <title>Chain Map</title>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/chain-map/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Definitions Let \(C_\bullet\) and \(D_\bullet\) be chain complexes. A *chain map* from \(C_\bullet\) to \(D_\bullet\) is a collection of homomorphisms \( f_n:C_n\to D_n \) such that \(d_nf_n=f_{n-1}d_n:C_n\to D_{n-1}\) for all \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\).
In other words, a chain map is a collection of homomorphisms such that each square in the above diagram commutes.
Lemmata Lemma: A chain map \(f_\bullet:C_\bullet\to D_\bullet\) induces homomorphisms \(f_n:H_n(C_\bullet)\to H_n(D_\bullet)\) in homology, for all \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\).
Proof: Think about it for a moment; any element in \(H_n(C_\bullet)\) can be represented by \(\sigma + {\rm im}(d_{n+1}^C)\) where \(\sigma\in C_n\).</description>

      <title>Chain Homotopy</title>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/chain-homotopy/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The motivation for the concept of a chain homotopy is to abstract the prism operator to a more algebraic setting.
Note that this diagram is not a &amp;ldquo;commutative diagram&amp;rdquo;, but since \(f\) and \(g\) are chain maps, there are two commutative &amp;ldquo;sub&amp;rdquo;-diagrams.
Definition If \(C_\bullet\) and \(D_\bullet\) are chain complexes, and \(f,g:C_\bullet\to D_\bullet\) are chain maps, then a *chain homotopy* from \(f\) to \(g\) is a colleciton of homomorphisms \(P:C_n\to D_{n+1}\) such that for all \(n\),</description>

      <title>Homotopy Invariance</title>
      <link>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/homotopy-invariance/</link>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/homotopy-invariance/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Homotopy invariance is a key theorem from algebraic topology. It says that if two maps are homotopic then they induce the same singular homology homomorphism. The prerequisite notions for this theorem are singular homology and the prism operator.
Statement and Proof Theorem: Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. If \(f,g:X\to Y\) are homotopic, then their induced singular homology homomorphisms are equal:
\[ f_* = g_* : H_n(X) \to H_n(Y).</description>

      <title>The Prism Operator</title>
      <link>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/prism-operator/</link>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/prism-operator/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The motivation for studying the prism operator comes from proving homotopy invariance. The prism operator takes a singular n-chain and forms a singular (n+1)-chain from it by passing the n-chain through a homotopy, creating &amp;ldquo;prisms&amp;rdquo; in the process.
As an introduction, we first study the 2-dimensional case. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces, \(H:X\times I\to Y\) be a homotopy, and \(\sigma:\Delta^2\to X\) be a singular 2-simplex in \(X\). We can then form a prism by passing \(\sigma\) through the homotopy:</description>
