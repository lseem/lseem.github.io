      <description>In this blog post, we continue where we left off in order to derive Euler&amp;rsquo;s Criterion. First, we define some key terms that will be important to us.
Definition (quadratic residue): Let \(m\in\mathbb{N}\), and let \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\) be coprime to \(m\). We say that \(a\) is a quadratic residue modulo \(m\) if there exists \(x\in\mathbb{Z}\) such that \(x^2\equiv_m a\). We say that \(a\) is a quadratic non-residue modulo \(m\) if there does not exist any such \(x\).</description>

      <description>(NB: This post was uploaded well after the exam, as these count as my own notes and wished to use them for the open book exam.)
I have a number theory exam coming up, and I really need to understand the famous Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. In the following series of blogposts, I will outline a proof of this Law, beginning with the Two Square Roots Lemma, then moving on to Euler&amp;rsquo;s Criterion (which we derive as a corollary of a more general theorem), after which we shall prove Gauss&#39; Lemma (one of his many&amp;hellip;), and then finally arrive at the Law.</description>
