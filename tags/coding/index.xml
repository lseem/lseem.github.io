      <description>I have a project in mind, and this project is to write a ray tracer for non-Euclidean geometries. While ultimately I am looking for full generality and would like to ray trace on any sufficiently regular 3-manifold, I will modestly set my first thousand-mile stone to ray tracing in the 3-sphere or in hyperbolic 3-space.
This project is mainly inspired by the film Interstellar, whose visual effects production studio Double Negative wrote a renderer in order to render the black hole in the film.</description>
