      <description>I have uploaded two new videos for the Multivarible Calculus revision series about submanifolds (which you can find under Resources):
 Part 2 - Tangent Spaces Part 3 - Level Sets as Submanifolds  While the video on tangent spaces was relatively easy, the other video about level sets was much harder. It is a more difficult topic to explain, and it took me a while to find the right picture which will give everything in detail.</description>

      <title>Revision Videos for Multivariable Calculus at Warwick</title>

      <description>I have in the past few days uploaded some revision videos for the Multivariable Calculus course at Warwick (2020 &amp;ndash; 2021) taught by Mario Micallef. You can find them under Resources. Currently, they contain references to &amp;ldquo;the notes&amp;rdquo;. I may update them at some later point, removing all such references.
The point of the videos is not to go over the rigour and the proofs, but to give a higher level and intuitive view of the course.</description>
