      <description>Introduction Definitions A chain complex is a sequence of abelian groups \( C_n \) (one for each \( n\in\mathbb{Z} \)) together with maps \( d_n:C_n\to C_{n-1} \) called *differentials* such that \( d_nd_{n+1}=0 \) for every \( n\in\mathbb{Z} \).
We define the group of n-cycles \(Z_n(C_\bullet) := \ker(d_n:C_n\to C_{n-1})\), and we define the *group of n-boundaries* \(B_n(C_\bullet) := {\rm im}(d_{n+1}:C_{n+1}\to C_n)\).
Since \(d^2=0\), \(B_n\subset Z_n\). This permits us to define the n-homology group to be the quotient</description>

      <description>Introduction Definitions Let \(C_\bullet\) and \(D_\bullet\) be chain complexes. A *chain map* from \(C_\bullet\) to \(D_\bullet\) is a collection of homomorphisms \( f_n:C_n\to D_n \) such that \(d_nf_n=f_{n-1}d_n:C_n\to D_{n-1}\) for all \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\).
In other words, a chain map is a collection of homomorphisms such that each square in the above diagram commutes.
Lemmata Lemma: A chain map \(f_\bullet:C_\bullet\to D_\bullet\) induces homomorphisms \(f_n:H_n(C_\bullet)\to H_n(D_\bullet)\) in homology, for all \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\).
Proof: Think about it for a moment; any element in \(H_n(C_\bullet)\) can be represented by \(\sigma + {\rm im}(d_{n+1}^C)\) where \(\sigma\in C_n\).</description>

      <description>Introduction The motivation for the concept of a chain homotopy is to abstract the prism operator to a more algebraic setting.
Note that this diagram is not a &amp;ldquo;commutative diagram&amp;rdquo;, but since \(f\) and \(g\) are chain maps, there are two commutative &amp;ldquo;sub&amp;rdquo;-diagrams.
Definition If \(C_\bullet\) and \(D_\bullet\) are chain complexes, and \(f,g:C_\bullet\to D_\bullet\) are chain maps, then a *chain homotopy* from \(f\) to \(g\) is a colleciton of homomorphisms \(P:C_n\to D_{n+1}\) such that for all \(n\),</description>

      <description>Introduction Homotopy invariance is a key theorem from algebraic topology. It says that if two maps are homotopic then they induce the same singular homology homomorphism. The prerequisite notions for this theorem are singular homology and the prism operator.
Statement and Proof Theorem: Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. If \(f,g:X\to Y\) are homotopic, then their induced singular homology homomorphisms are equal:
\[ f_* = g_* : H_n(X) \to H_n(Y).</description>

      <title>The Prism Operator</title>

      <description>Introduction The motivation for studying the prism operator comes from proving homotopy invariance. The prism operator takes a singular n-chain and forms a singular (n+1)-chain from it by passing the n-chain through a homotopy, creating &amp;ldquo;prisms&amp;rdquo; in the process.
As an introduction, we first study the 2-dimensional case. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces, \(H:X\times I\to Y\) be a homotopy, and \(\sigma:\Delta^2\to X\) be a singular 2-simplex in \(X\). We can then form a prism by passing \(\sigma\) through the homotopy:</description>
