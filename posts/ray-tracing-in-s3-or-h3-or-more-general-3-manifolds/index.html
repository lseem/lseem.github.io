<p>I have a project in mind, and this project is to write a ray tracer for non-Euclidean geometries. While ultimately I am looking for full generality and would like to ray trace on any sufficiently regular 3-manifold, I will modestly set my first thousand-mile stone to ray tracing in the 3-sphere or in hyperbolic 3-space.</p>
<p>This project is mainly inspired by the film <em>Interstellar</em>, whose visual effects production studio <a href="https://dneg.com">Double Negative</a> wrote a renderer in order to render the black hole in the film. This renderer, the <em>Double Negative Gravitational Renderer</em>, was written in collaboration with Kip Thorne with the intention to essentially &ldquo;simulate&rdquo; general relativity so that the viewer would see such effects as gravitational lensing.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the plan of action.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to write this ray tracer in <a href="https://rust-lang.org">rust</a> because I am not a good programmer and so am not to be trusted with such dangerous tools as C/C++. I&rsquo;m first going to write this ray tracer for the CPU, and then I&rsquo;m going to modify it so that it works on the GPU instead for performance benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to write one for Euclidean 3-space first. I will include my own way of dealing with linear algebra, and make sure that stuff works in the standard way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on which seems easier, I will modify this Euclidean ray tracer to either ray trace in \(S^3\) or in \(H^3\).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to ray trace in \(H^3\) it may be that all I will have to do will be to change from ordinary linear algebra to Lorentzian linear algebra. But on the other hand, \(S^3\) can be modelled as a subset of \(\mathbb{R}^4\) rather easily and so it could be that this is actually easier. One could also unify these approaches by having a radius parameter that ranges over \(\mathbb{C}\), so that we have \(S^3\) when the radius is \(1\), and \(H^3\) when the radius is \(i\). Either way, we shall see.</p>
<p>Something to note is that there has been some research done into this already. From what I could find, there has been already some research done at the <a href="https://www.visgraf.impa.br/home/">Vision and Graphics Laboratory</a> at IMPA in Brazil. A couple of useful papers are</p>
<ul>
<li>Luiz Velho, Vinicius da Silva, and Tiago Novello. <strong>&ldquo;Immersive Visualization of the Classical Non-Euclidean Spaces using Real-Time Ray Tracing in VR&rdquo;</strong>. In Proceedings of the 46th Graphics Interface, 2020. <a href="https://www.visgraf.impa.br/Data/RefBib/PS_PDF/gi2020/gi2020.pdf">pdf</a></li>
<li>Tiago Novello, Vinicius da Silva, and Luiz Velho. <strong>&ldquo;Global Illumination of Non-Euclidean Spaces&rdquo;</strong>. Technical Report TR-06-2020, VISGRAF Lab - IMPA, 2020. <a href="https://www.visgraf.impa.br/Data/RefBib/PS_PDF/tr-06-2020/tr-06-2020.pdf">pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another cautionary note is that a lot people on youtube who claim to have non-Euclidean ray tracers are actually just using portals and the such like. My project aims to accurately simulate the diffeo-geometric phenomena of ray tracing in curved 3-manifolds. For example, in \(S^3\), if you look in front of you, assuming that the light doesn&rsquo;t dim etc, then you should see your back, flipped horizontally and vertically. I want this to fall naturally out of the ray tracing mechanism, I don&rsquo;t want it to be some sort of contrived portal system.</p>
