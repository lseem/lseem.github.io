<p><em>(NB: This post was uploaded well after the exam, as these count as my own notes and wished to use them for the open book exam.)</em></p>
<p>I have a number theory exam coming up, and I really need to understand the famous Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. In the following series of blogposts, I will outline a proof of this Law, beginning with the Two Square Roots Lemma, then moving on to Euler&rsquo;s Criterion (which we derive as a corollary of a more general theorem), after which we shall prove Gauss' Lemma (one of his many&hellip;), and then finally arrive at the Law.</p>
<p>The approach is based on lectures by Adam Harper, but I have reworded many things to suit my own taste of exposition.</p>
<p>Prerequisites include some very basic group and ring theory: the reader should be familiar with what an integral domain is, and should also be familiar with properties of groups like \(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\) and \((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\).</p>
<p><strong>Lemma (Two Square Roots):</strong> Let \(p\) be an odd prime. Then for any \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\) coprime to \(p\), the number of \(x\in(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\) such that \(x^2\equiv_p a\) is either \(2\) or \(0\).</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em> Firstly, suppose that \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) solve \(x^2\equiv_p a\). Then \(x_1^2 - x_2^2 \equiv_p 0\), so \((x_1-x_2)(x_1+x_2)\equiv_p0\). Now since \(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\) is an integral domain, we have that \(x_1-x_2\equiv_p0\) or \(x_1+x_2\equiv_p0\). So \(x_1\equiv_p\pm x_2\).</p>
<p>Secondly, suppose that \(x_1\) solves the same equation. Then \(-x_1\) also solves that equation. Since \(p\) is odd, \(x_1\not\equiv_p-x_1\). So if the equation has a solution, then it has exactly two solutions.</p>
<p>Therefore, either \(x^2\equiv_p a\) has no solutions, or it has at least one solution, in which case it has exactly two solutions. QED.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary:</strong> There are precisely \((p-1)/2\) elements of \((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\) that are quadratic residues modulo \(p\), and precisely the same number that are not.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em> By the Two Square-Roots Lemma, for every \(x\in(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\), the equation \(y^2\equiv_p x^2\) has exactly two solutions: \(y\equiv_px\) and \(y\equiv_p-x\). So every element in \((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\) has a matching element which uniquely give rise to the same square. So there are \(\#(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}/2 = (p-1)/2\) pairs, so there are the same number of squares (i.e. quadratic residues) modulo \(p\). Therefore there are the same number of elements that are <em>not</em> squares (i.e. quadratic <em>non</em>-residues) modulo \(p\). QED.</p>
