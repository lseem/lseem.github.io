<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>It is difficult to find this rather nice way of looking at connections in differential geometry textbooks. Perhaps because it is not so much of use in Riemannian geometry (where your connection is basically always the Levi-Cività connection so in fact all the curvature is induced by the metric). But still, I think it&rsquo;s nice and prepares the student for further study in geometry.</p>
<p>In this article I&rsquo;ll explain two Nice and Satisfying Things about this point of view. The first will be all about local representations (so we&rsquo;ll finish and transition formula) and then we&rsquo;ll talk about connections on principal bundles.</p>
<p>It has been said that this way of looking at connections is popular in gauge theory, but I&rsquo;m not a physicist and nor do I feel well-versed enough in physics in order to substantiate this claim.</p>
<p>So let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold, and let $E$ be a vector bundle of rank $k$ over $M$.</p>
<p>Consider a connection $\Nabla:\T(M)\times\Ga(E)\to\Ga(E)$ over $M$; that is (by our usual definitions) a map such that for any functions $f,g\in C^\infty(M)$, vector fields $X,Y\T(M)$, and section $\si\in\Ga(E)$,
i. $\del_X(f\si)=(Xf)\si + f\del_X\si$ (the Leibniz law in the &ldquo;section of $E$&rdquo; argument;
ii. $\del_{fX+gY}\si = f\del_X\si + g\del_Y\si$ (tensorial in the &ldquo;direction (vector field)&rdquo; argument
iii. $\Nabla_\cdot \si$ is $\R$-linear in the $\T(M)$ (direction/vector field) argument.</p>
<p>This definition of a connection requires us to <em>specify</em> the direction in which we wish to differentiate. But what if we want to withhold this direction?</p>
<p>In plain old $\R^n$, we do this all the time. Recall that for a function $f\in C^\infty(\R^n)$ we can take its directional derivative in the direction of some $v\in\R^n$, defined by
$$ \pd_vf (x) := \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+hv) - f(x)}{h}. $$
But we can recover this from the Jacobian $Df$ of $f$ via matrix multiplication:
$$ \pd_v f = (Df)v. $$
So the Jacobian is an object which allows us to &ldquo;withhold the direction&rdquo; of differentiation until later. It turns out that we can also do this for connections.</p>
<p>The trick is to consider the map $\d_A:\Ga(E)\to\Ga(T^*M\otimes E)$ defined by <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
$$ (\d_A\si)(X) := \nabla_X\si. $$
Take a moment to to convince yourself that $\d_A\si = \nabla_X\cdot$ should indeed spit out an $E$-valued 1-form.</p>
<p>Indeed, by (i) above, we have
$$\begin{align*}
\d_A(f\si)(X) &amp;= \nabla_X(f\si) \
&amp;= (Xf)\si + f\nabla_X\si \
&amp;= \si(\d{f})(X) + f(\d_A\si)X,
\end{align*}$$
or in other words, out Leibniz law becomes
$$ \d_A(f\si) = \si\d{f} + f\d_A\si. $$
Check that each term makes sense (what do I mean by $\si\d{f}$ - how can I multiply a <em>section</em> with a <em>1-form</em>? <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>)</p>
<p>By (ii) above, we have tensoriality in the &ldquo;direction&rdquo; argument. This is precisely what is captured by the output space $\Ga(T^*M\otimes E)$ of $E$-valued 1-forms on $M$. Finally, by (iii) above, we have linearity over $\R$ in the section argument.</p>
<h2 id="nice-and-satisfying-thing-1-local-representatives">Nice and Satisfying Thing #1: Local Representatives</h2>
<p>Did you know that your connection can have local representatives? In the previous formulation, this fact is slightly obscured. But now in this new formulation, we will see that our connection locally decomposes as a sum of the <strong>exterior derivative</strong> and a <strong>matrix of $E$-valued 1-forms</strong>!</p>
<p>So let $U_\a$ be a chart inducing a bundle chart $U_\a\times\R^k$ of the bundle $E$. Then any section $\si:M\to E$ is locally a map $\si_\a:U_\a\to U_\a\times\R^k$; that is, a map $\si_\a: U_\a\to\R^k$.</p>
<p>Consider the constant sections $e_j:U_\a\to\R^k$
$$ e_j = (0,\ldots,1,\ldots,0). $$
Then $\d_Ae_j$ is a vector of 1-forms<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
$$ \d_Ae_j = e_i\om^i_j $$
for some 1-forms $\om^i_j\in\T^<em>(U_\a)$. Then since the bundle is trivial on $U_\a$, we can write our section $\si=e_j\si^j$ as a sum of component functions $\si^j:U_\a\to\R$. So on $U_\a$,
$$\begin{align</em>}
\d_A\si_\a &amp;= \d_A(e_j\si^j) \
&amp;= e_j\d\si^j + \si^j\d_A e_j \
&amp;= e_j\d\si_\a + \si^j\e_i\om^i_j
\end{align*}$$
which we can write more succinctly as
$$ \d_A\si_\a = \d\si_\a + \om\si_\a. $$
So on $U_\a$, we have
$$ \d_A = d+\om. $$
We call $\om$ the <strong>local representative of the connection</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, as we should all be accustomed to by now, local representatives mean we get transition formulae for computing across charts. So suppose that $\d_A$ has local representative $\om_\a$ on $U_\a$, and $\om_\b$ on $U_\b$. Then certainly for any section $\si$,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
$$ \d_A\si_\a = g_{\a\b}\d_A\si_\b. $$
Therefore
$$ \d\si_\a + \om_\a\si_\a = g_{\a\b}(\d\si_\b + \om_\b\si_\b). $$
But $\si_\b = g_{\a\b}^{-1}$ so we have
$$ \d\si_\a + \om_\a\si_\a = g_{\a\b}d(g_{\a\b}^{-1}\si_\a) + g_{\a\b}\om_\b g_{\a\b}^{-1}\si_\a. $$
Thus
$$ \d\si_\a + \om_\a\si_\a = \d\si_\a + g_{\a\b}(dg_{\a\b}^{-1} + \om_\b g_{\a\b}^{-1})\si_\a. $$
So our transition formula is
$$ \om_|a + g_{\a\b}\d{g_{\a\b}^{-1}} + g_{\a\b}\om_\b g_{\a\b}^{-1}. $$</p>
<p>As you may have been taught in your course on Riemannian geometry, whenever you have a transition formula then you can patch these local objects together to get a global object defined on the whole manifold. So in fact these transition formulae give us a whole other definition of a connection! Roughly speaking, a connection is an object that locally decomposes like $d + \om_\a$ where $\om_\a$ are $k\times k$ matrices of 1-forms that transform like above.</p>
<h2 id="nice-and-satisfying-thing-2-generalisation-to-principal-bundles">Nice and Satisfying Thing #2: Generalisation to Principal Bundles</h2>
<p>Recall that for a Lie group $G\subset\GL(\R^k)$, a $G$-bundle is a vector bundle $E$ over $M$ such that the transition functions of the fibres on overlapping charts
$$ g_{\a\b}:U_\a\cap U_\b\to\GL(\R^k) $$
take their values in $G$ (and not the possibly larger $\GL(\R^k)$).</p>
<p>So since $g_{\a\b}\in G$, we have that
$$ g_{\a\b}d{g_{\a\b}^{-1}}\in\Lie(G) $$
and also
$$ g_{\a\b}\om_\a g_{\a\b}^{-1}\in\Lie(G) $$
(check these facts for yourself). Therefore, by the transition formula above, we have that the local representatives $\om_\a$ are in the Lie algebra of $G$! In this way, we can define <strong>unitary connections</strong> and <strong>orthogonal connections</strong> or more generally $G$-connections, by requiring that their local representatives are in $\Lie(G)$.</p>
<p>So there we are. Two Nice and Satisfying Things about this point of view of connections. In a subsequent article I will expand further and calculate some examples. Obvious questions remain: What does compatibility of the Levi-Cività connection look like in this formalism? How does this formalism relate to the covariant derivatives of surfaces in $\R^3$? Can I define a pullback connection? What happens with parallel transport?</p>
