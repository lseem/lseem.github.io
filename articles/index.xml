      <description>Introduction It is difficult to find this rather nice way of looking at connections in differential geometry textbooks. Perhaps because it is not so much of use in Riemannian geometry (where your connection is basically always the Levi-Civit√† connection so in fact all the curvature is induced by the metric). But still, I think it&amp;rsquo;s nice and prepares the student for further study in geometry.
In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll explain two Nice and Satisfying Things about this point of view.</description>
