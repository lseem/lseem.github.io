<dt><strong>Warwick Mathematics Institute Graduate Teaching Assistant, October 2021 &ndash; July 2022</strong></dt>
<dd>I supervise five first-year undergraduate students by marking their (analysis, differential equations, linear algebra, abstract algebra, and geometry and motion) assignments and holding two supervisions per week.</dd>

<dd>I mentored an A' level student from a state school through the university application for maths, helped them with learning the further maths A' level and <a href="http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test">MAT</a> as their school did not offer this.</dd>
<dt><strong><a href="https://www.lms.ac.uk/events/lms-summer-schools">LMS Summer School 2021</a>, July 2021</strong></dt>
<dd>I attended this selective two-week long summer school with mini-courses and colloquia.</dd>
