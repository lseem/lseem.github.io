<li>Under <a href="https://geometry-analysis.lseem.xyz">Geometry and Analysis</a> you can find a more formal collection of (auto)didactic material; the long-term goal is to have a comprehensive set of material for anyone to learn topics in geometry and analysis.</li>
<li>Under <a href="/articles/">Articles</a> you can find short articles; these are usually written to explain things to myself.</li>

<dt><strong>Warwick Maths Society Talks: Is the Critical Catenoid Alone? Finding Friends of Minimal Surfaces using PDEs, 07 Dec 2021</strong></dt>
<dd>I present the results of my summer 2020 research projects to other undergraduates.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Warwick Mathematics Institute Graduate Teaching Assistant, October 2021 – July 2022</strong></dt>
<dd>I supervised five first-year undergraduate students by marking their assignments and holding two small group teaching sessions per week.
</dd>
<dt><strong><a href="https://zerogravity.co.uk">Zero Gravity</a> Mentor, July 2021 – November 2021</strong></dt>
<dd>I mentored an A’ level student from a state school through the university application for maths, helped them with learning the further maths A’ level and <a href="http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test">MAT</a> as their school did not offer this.
</dd>
<dt><strong><a href="https://www.lms.ac.uk/events/lms-summer-schools">LMS Summer School 2021</a>, July 2021</strong></dt>
<dd>I attended this selective two-week long summer school with mini-courses and colloquia.
</dd>
<dt><strong><a href="https://warwickmaths.com">Warwick Maths Society</a> Academic Support Officer, March 2020 – March 2021</strong></dt>
<dd>I ran weekly 2-hour sessions with the other academic support officer to help students with anything they might be struggling with in the course. I provided free food (customarily hummus and other lunch-y things). I also created resources for students.
</dd>
<dt><strong><a href="/projects/summer-research-project/">URSS Research Project 2020</a>, Summer 2020</strong></dt>
<dd>I was awarded £1000 from the university in order to do an 8-week long research project on free boundary minimal surfaces in the unit ball.
</dd>
<dt><strong><a href="https://warwickmaths.com">Warwick Maths Society</a> Talks Coordinator, March 2019 – March 2020</strong></dt>
<dd>I organised weekly talks that might be of interest to maths students in the society. I ran them online due to the COVID pandemic.
