<p>This essay serves as a criticism of the Fine-Tuning Argument (henceforth, for brevity, referred to using the acronym FTA) for the existence of God.
In order to do so we recognise FTAâ€™s reliance on the notion of Common Sense.
We then analyse the notion of Common Sense, and find where it is or is not valid.
Having found that Common Sense is only valid from certain perspectives, we then show that the FTA, relying on Common Sense, is made from a perspective where Common Sense is not valid.
Therefore the FTA is not a valid argument for the existence of God.</p>
