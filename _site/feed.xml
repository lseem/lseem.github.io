&lt;p&gt;I have a number theory exam coming up, and I really need to understand the famous Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. In the following series of blogposts, I will outline a proof of this Law, beginning with the Two Square Roots Lemma, then moving on to Euler’s Criterion (which we derive as a corollary of a more general theorem), after which we shall prove Gauss’ Lemma (one of his many…), and then finally arrive at the Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach is based on lectures by Adam Harper, but I have reworded many things to suit my own taste of exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites include some very basic group and ring theory: the reader should be familiar with what an integral domain is, and should also be familiar with properties of groups like \(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\) and \((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma (Two Square Roots):&lt;/strong&gt; Let \(p\) be an odd prime. Then for any \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\) coprime to \(p\), the number of \(x\in(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\) such that \(x^2\equiv_p a\) is either \(2\) or \(0\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof:&lt;/em&gt; Firstly, suppose that \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) solve \(x^2\equiv_p a\). Then \(x_1^2 - x_2^2 \equiv_p 0\), so \((x_1-x_2)(x_1+x_2)\equiv_p0\). Now since \(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\) is an integral domain, we have that \(x_1-x_2\equiv_p0\) or \(x_1+x_2\equiv_p0\). So \(x_1\equiv_p\pm x_2\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, suppose that \(x_1\) solves the same equation. Then \(-x_1\) also solves that equation. Since \(p\) is odd, \(x_1\not\equiv_p-x_1\). So if the equation has a solution, then it has exactly two solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, either \(x^2\equiv_p a\) has no solutions, or it has at least one solution, in which case it has exactly two solutions. QED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary:&lt;/strong&gt; There are precisely \((p-1)/2\) elements of \((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\) that are quadratic residues modulo \(p\), and precisely the same number that are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof:&lt;/em&gt; By the Two Square-Roots Lemma, for every \(x\in(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\), the equation \(y^2\equiv_p x^2\) has exactly two solutions: \(y\equiv_px\) and \(y\equiv_p-x\). So every element in \((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\) has a matching element which uniquely give rise to the same square. So there are \(\#(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}/2 = (p-1)/2\) pairs, so there are the same number of squares (i.e. quadratic residues) modulo \(p\). Therefore there are the same number of elements that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; squares (i.e. quadratic &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-residues) modulo \(p\).

First, we define some key terms that will be important to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition (quadratic residue):&lt;/strong&gt; Let \(m\in\mathbb{N}\), and let \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\) be coprime to \(m\). We say that \(a\) is a quadratic residue modulo \(m\) if there exists \(x\in\mathbb{Z}\) such that \(x^2\equiv_m a\). We say that \(a\) is a quadratic non-residue modulo \(m\) if there does not exist any such \(x\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition (Legendre symbol):&lt;/strong&gt; Let \(p\) be an odd prime, and let \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\). Then the Legendre symbol is defined as
\[ \begin{pmatrix}a\\p\end{pmatrix} := \begin{cases}
    0 &amp;amp; \text{if } p|a \&lt;br /&gt;
    1 &amp;amp; \text{if } a \text{ is a quadratic residue modulo }p \&lt;br /&gt;
    -1 &amp;amp; \text{if }a \text{ is a quadratic non-residue modulo }p. \end{cases} \]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Let \(p\) be an odd prime. Then for any \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\) that is coprime to \(p\), we have
\[ -\begin{pmatrix} a \\ p \end{pmatrix} a^{(p-1)/2} \equiv_p (p-1)!. \]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof:&lt;/em&gt; Suppose first that \(a\) is a quadratic non-residue modulo \(p\). Then
\[ (p-1)! \equiv_p a\cdot\prod_{j\in(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\setminus\{1,a\}}j. \]
Now, since \((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\) is a group, for each \(j\) in the above product there is a unique element \(y\) in the product such that \(jy\equiv_p a\). So we match these elements up with each other to obtain \((p-1)/2\) pairs whose product is \(a\), giving
\[ (p-1)! \equiv_p a\cdot a^{(p-3)/2} \equiv_p a^{(p-1)/2} \equiv_p - \begin{pmatrix} a \\ p \end{pmatrix} a^{(p-1)/2}. \]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose that \(a\) is a quadratic residue modulo \(p\), so that \(a\equiv_p x^2\) for some \(x\in(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\). Since \(p\) is odd, \(x\not\equiv_pp-x\), and so \(x(p-x)\equiv_p-x^2\equiv_pa\). Therefore,
\[ (p-1)! \equiv_p -a\cdot\prod_{j\in(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\setminus\{x,p-x\}}j. \]
Similarly to the first case, since \((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\) is a group, for each \(j\) in the above product there is a unique element \(y\) in the product such that \(jy\equiv_p a\). So we match these elements up with each other to obtain \((p-1)/2\) pairs whose product is \(a\), giving
\[ (p-1)! \equiv_p -a\cdot a^{(p-3)/2} \equiv_p -a^{(p-1)/2} \equiv_p -\begin{pmatrix} a \\ p \end{pmatrix} a^{(p-1)/2}. \]
QED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary (Wilson’s Theorem):&lt;/strong&gt; If \(p\) is prime, then \((p-1)!\equiv_p -1\). If \(m\geq6\) is composite, then \((m-1)!\equiv_m0\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof:&lt;/em&gt; If \(p\) is prime, then take \(a=1\) in Theorem 1, and the result follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let \(m\geq6\) be composite. Then \(m=ab\) for some \(a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\). Then noticing that
\[ a+b = a+\frac{m}{a} \leq 2 + \frac{m}{2} \leq m-1, \]
we break the product up:
\[ (m-1)! = \prod_{j=1}^aj\cdot\prod_{k=a+1}^{a+b}k\cdot\prod_{l=a+b+1}^{m-1}l, \]
whence we deduce that, since \(a\) divides the first product and \(b\) divides the second product, the whole product is divisible by \(ab=m\), and so
\[ (m-1)! \equiv_m 0.\]
QED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary (Euler’s Criterion):&lt;/strong&gt; Let \(p\) be an odd prime and let \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\) be coprime to \(p\). Then
\[ \begin{pmatrix}a\\ p\end{pmatrix}\equiv_p a^{(p-1)/2}. \]
&lt;em&gt;Proof:&lt;/em&gt; By Wilson’s Theorem \((p-1)!\equiv_p -1\). So by Theorem 1, 
\[ -1 \equiv_p (p-1)! \equiv_p -\begin{pmatrix}a\\p\end{pmatrix}a^{(p-1)/2}, \]
therefore
\[ a^{(p-1)/2} \equiv_p \left[1\middle/ \begin{pmatrix}a\\p\end{pmatrix}\right] \equiv_p \begin{pmatrix}a\\p\end{pmatrix}.\]

While ultimately I am looking for full generality and would like to ray trace on any sufficiently regular 3-manifold, I will modestly set my first thousand-mile stone to ray tracing in the 3-sphere or in hyperbolic 3-space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is mainly inspired by the film &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;, whose visual effects production studio &lt;a href=&quot;https://dneg.com&quot;&gt;Double Negative&lt;/a&gt; wrote a renderer in order to render the black hole in the film. This renderer, the &lt;em&gt;Double Negative Gravitational Renderer&lt;/em&gt;, was written in collaboration with Kip Thorne with the intention to essentially “simulate” general relativity so that the viewer would see such effects as gravitational lensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the plan of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m going to write this ray tracer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;rust&lt;/a&gt; because I am not a good programmer and so am not to be trusted with such dangerous tools as C/C++. I’m first going to write this ray tracer for the CPU, and then I’m going to modify it so that it works on the GPU instead for performance benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m going to write one for Euclidean 3-space first. I will include my own way of dealing with linear algebra, and make sure that stuff works in the standard way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending on which seems easier, I will modify this Euclidean ray tracer to either ray trace in \(S^3\) or in \(H^3\).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ray trace in \(H^3\) it may be that all I will have to do will be to change from ordinary linear algebra to Lorentzian linear algebra. But on the other hand, \(S^3\) can be modelled as a subset of \(\mathbb{R}^4\) rather easily and so it could be that this is actually easier. One could also unify these approaches by having a radius parameter that ranges over \(\mathbb{C}\), so that we have \(S^3\) when the radius is \(1\), and \(H^3\) when the radius is \(i\). Either way, we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to note is that there has been some research done into this already. From what I could find, there has been already some research done at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visgraf.impa.br/home/&quot;&gt;Vision and Graphics Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; at IMPA in Brazil. A couple of useful papers are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luiz Velho, Vinicius da Silva, and Tiago Novello. &lt;strong&gt;“Immersive Visualization of the Classical Non-Euclidean Spaces using Real-Time Ray Tracing in VR”&lt;/strong&gt;. In Proceedings of the 46th Graphics Interface, 2020. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visgraf.impa.br/Data/RefBib/PS_PDF/gi2020/gi2020.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cautionary note is that a lot people on youtube who claim to have non-Euclidean ray tracers are actually just using portals and the such like. My project aims to accurately simulate the diffeo-geometric phenomena of ray tracing in curved 3-manifolds. For example, in \(S^3\), if you look in front of you, assuming that the light doesn’t dim etc, then you should see your back, flipped horizontally and vertically. I want this to fall naturally out of the ray tracing mechanism, I don’t want it to be some sort of contrived portal system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="maths" /><category term="coding" /><summary type="html">I have a project in mind, and this project is to write a ray tracer for non-Euclidean geometries.
