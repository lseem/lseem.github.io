      <description>Introduction This is an overview article for algebraic topology.
Typical Undergraduate Course A typical undergraduate course in algebraic topology will consist of the following topics:
 simplicial homology (broken link) singular homology (broken link)  homotopy invariance mayer vietoris (broken link) relative homology (broken link) reduced homology    References and Notes  This article is based on a lecture course on algebraic topology given at Warwick by Chris Lazda.</description>

      <title>Important Theoremata of Undergraduate Mathematics</title>

      <description>Introduction In this overview article, I list some theoremata that I think should summarise an undergraduate mathematics degree.
Often, I can get overwhelmed by the details of a course, and so I find it useful to just sit down and list the main results. Usually, they only take up half a page. Then, I focus on figuring out the proofs of these main results, and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all I need to know for the course: there&amp;rsquo;s no need to actively try to remember the definition of some obscure object, because chances are it&amp;rsquo;s been defined just to be able to prove a theorem (there are some important definitions, but I&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up remembering them just by the sheer number of times I use them while learning the subject).</description>

      <title>Exact Sequence</title>

      <description>Introduction The motivation for this algebraic structure comes from abstracting out important features of the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence.
Definitions A sequence of abelian groups and homomorphisms
\[ A_n \overset{d_n}{\longrightarrow} \cdots \longrightarrow A_{i+1} \overset{d_{i+1}}{\longrightarrow} A_i \overset{d_i}{\longrightarrow} A_{i-1} \longrightarrow \cdots \overset{d_1}{\longrightarrow} A_0 \]
is exact at \(A_i\) if \(\ker d_i = {\rm im}d_{i+1}\). This only makes sense for \(0&amp;lt;i&amp;lt;n\).
We say that the above sequence is exact if it is exact at \(A_i\) for all \(0&amp;lt;i&amp;lt;n\).</description>

      <description>Introduction Definitions A chain complex is a sequence of abelian groups \( C_n \) (one for each \( n\in\mathbb{Z} \)) together with maps \( d_n:C_n\to C_{n-1} \) called *differentials* such that \( d_nd_{n+1}=0 \) for every \( n\in\mathbb{Z} \).
We define the group of n-cycles \(Z_n(C_\bullet) := \ker(d_n:C_n\to C_{n-1})\), and we define the *group of n-boundaries* \(B_n(C_\bullet) := {\rm im}(d_{n+1}:C_{n+1}\to C_n)\).
Since \(d^2=0\), \(B_n\subset Z_n\). This permits us to define the n-homology group to be the quotient</description>

      <title>Chain Map</title>

      <description>Introduction Definitions Let \(C_\bullet\) and \(D_\bullet\) be chain complexes. A *chain map* from \(C_\bullet\) to \(D_\bullet\) is a collection of homomorphisms \( f_n:C_n\to D_n \) such that \(d_nf_n=f_{n-1}d_n:C_n\to D_{n-1}\) for all \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\).
In other words, a chain map is a collection of homomorphisms such that each square in the above diagram commutes.
Lemmata Lemma: A chain map \(f_\bullet:C_\bullet\to D_\bullet\) induces homomorphisms \(f_n:H_n(C_\bullet)\to H_n(D_\bullet)\) in homology, for all \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\).
Proof: Think about it for a moment; any element in \(H_n(C_\bullet)\) can be represented by \(\sigma + {\rm im}(d_{n+1}^C)\) where \(\sigma\in C_n\).</description>

      <title>Chain Homotopy</title>

      <description>Introduction The motivation for the concept of a chain homotopy is to abstract the prism operator to a more algebraic setting.
Note that this diagram is not a &amp;ldquo;commutative diagram&amp;rdquo;, but since \(f\) and \(g\) are chain maps, there are two commutative &amp;ldquo;sub&amp;rdquo;-diagrams.
Definition If \(C_\bullet\) and \(D_\bullet\) are chain complexes, and \(f,g:C_\bullet\to D_\bullet\) are chain maps, then a *chain homotopy* from \(f\) to \(g\) is a colleciton of homomorphisms \(P:C_n\to D_{n+1}\) such that for all \(n\),</description>

      <title>Homotopy Invariance</title>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/homotopy-invariance/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Homotopy invariance is a key theorem from algebraic topology. It says that if two maps are homotopic then they induce the same singular homology homomorphism. The prerequisite notions for this theorem are singular homology and the prism operator.
Statement and Proof Theorem: Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. If \(f,g:X\to Y\) are homotopic, then their induced singular homology homomorphisms are equal:
\[ f_* = g_* : H_n(X) \to H_n(Y).</description>

      <title>The Prism Operator</title>
      <link>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/prism-operator/</link>

      <guid>http://lseem.xyz/wiki/prism-operator/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The motivation for studying the prism operator comes from proving homotopy invariance. The prism operator takes a singular n-chain and forms a singular (n+1)-chain from it by passing the n-chain through a homotopy, creating &amp;ldquo;prisms&amp;rdquo; in the process.
As an introduction, we first study the 2-dimensional case. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces, \(H:X\times I\to Y\) be a homotopy, and \(\sigma:\Delta^2\to X\) be a singular 2-simplex in \(X\). We can then form a prism by passing \(\sigma\) through the homotopy:</description>

      <description>TODO: Migrate to wiki
In this blog post, we continue where we left off in order to derive Euler&amp;rsquo;s Criterion. First, we define some key terms that will be important to us.
Definition (quadratic residue): Let \(m\in\mathbb{N}\), and let \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\) be coprime to \(m\). We say that \(a\) is a quadratic residue modulo \(m\) if there exists \(x\in\mathbb{Z}\) such that \(x^2\equiv_m a\). We say that \(a\) is a quadratic non-residue modulo \(m\) if there does not exist any such \(x\).</description>

      <description>TODO: Migrate to wiki
(NB: This post was uploaded well after the exam, as these count as my own notes and wished to use them for the open book exam.)
I have a number theory exam coming up, and I really need to understand the famous Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. In the following series of blogposts, I will outline a proof of this Law, beginning with the Two Square Roots Lemma, then moving on to Euler&amp;rsquo;s Criterion (which we derive as a corollary of a more general theorem), after which we shall prove Gauss&#39; Lemma (one of his many&amp;hellip;), and then finally arrive at the Law.</description>

      <title>Ray Tracing in \(S^3\) or \(H^3\) (or more general 3-Manifolds?)</title>

      <description>I have a project in mind, and this project is to write a ray tracer for non-Euclidean geometries. While ultimately I am looking for full generality and would like to ray trace on any sufficiently regular 3-manifold, I will modestly set my first thousand-mile stone to ray tracing in the 3-sphere or in hyperbolic 3-space.
This project is mainly inspired by the film Interstellar, whose visual effects production studio Double Negative wrote a renderer in order to render the black hole in the film.</description>

      <description>In my second year I wrote The Isoperimetric Problem: Geometry and Analysis and I guess I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud of it. I think the markers didn&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that I didn&amp;rsquo;t provide pin-point references, so sorry! Although, below is a list of some references which I think you might want to take a look at:

      <description>Over the summer I did a project in free boundary minimal annuli in the unit ball. Specifically, I studied an object called the critical catenoid, which is the only known example of a free boundary minimal annulus in the unit ball. I made a poster.
This is an image I made of the critical catenoid with POV-Ray. I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get the lighting or material just how I want it.</description>
